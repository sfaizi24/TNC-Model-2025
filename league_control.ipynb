    "### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run `initial_data_load()` once to populate the database\n",
    "2. Run `weekly_update()` every Monday/Tuesday for latest results\n",
    "3. Check `show_database_status()` to see what data you have\n",
    "4. Use `show_player_stats()` to look up any player\n",
    "5. Check `show_bye_weeks()` before setting lineups\n",
